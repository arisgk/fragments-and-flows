            Hi, Iâ€™m Aris! Welcome to my personal website and digital garden!
          </p>
          <p class="text-base/6 sm:text-lg/7 md:text-xl/8 m-0 font-light">
            I write software, so much of the content in this blog is around
            software engineering, architecture and programming paradigms. I also
            enjoy digital product design, so you may read about user experience
            and human-computer interaction.
          </p>
          <p class="text-base/6 sm:text-lg/7 md:text-xl/8 m-0 font-light">
            But I dislike being a specialist. I enjoy reading philosophy and
            human sciences, especially political theory and sociology. I like
            reflecting on how we think and work, especially when it comes to
            knowledge work. I seek to understand the various ontologies behind
            philosophical systems and the flows of influence and association
            between thinkers.
          </p>
          <p class="text-base/6 sm:text-lg/7 md:text-xl/8 m-0 font-light">
            I believe there is something fundamentally wrong with the current
            social order and seek to analyze its inner workings while organizing
            with people that want to create alternatives. I endorse emancipatory
            social forms that broadly belong to the anarchist communist
            tradition.

            I am a member of a small software R&D collective, Oktana, and these
            days we are focusing on developing v2, a local-first rich text
            editor with version control capabilities.
